# Error Prevention & Best Practices
error_prevention:
  git:
    - rule: "Always use github-personal host for this repository"
      fix: "git remote set-url origin git@github-personal:92fueler/low_level_ds.git"
    - rule: "Ensure correct SSH key is used"
      check: "ssh -T git@github-personal"
      expected_output: "Hi 92fueler!"

  python:
    - rule: "Package structure must be defined for hatchling"
      fix: "Add packages list in pyproject.toml under [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]"
    - rule: "Reset singleton instances between tests"
      fix: "Add @pytest.fixture(autouse=True) to reset instance state"
    - rule: "Initialize package with __init__.py"
      check: "Ensure each package directory has __init__.py with proper exports"

# Development Workflow
workflow:
  setup:
    - "uv pip install -e ."  # Install package in development mode
    - "git remote set-url origin git@github-personal:92fueler/low_level_ds.git"  # Ensure correct remote

  test:
    commands:
      - "cd {package_dir} && uv run pytest tests/"  # Run from package directory
      - "uv run pytest {package_dir}/tests/"        # Run from project root
    notes: "Both command forms are valid, choose based on your current directory"

  git:
    pre_push_checks:
      - "ssh -T git@github-personal"  # Verify GitHub authentication
      - "git remote -v"               # Verify remote URL
